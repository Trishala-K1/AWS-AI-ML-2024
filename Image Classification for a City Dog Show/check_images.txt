Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architecures classified the breed of dog in Rottweiler_01.jpg correctly.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, each of the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Rottweiler_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Rottweiler_02.jpg even when image in Rottweiler_02.jpg was rotated.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: For cat_01.jpg (Animal_Name_01.jpg), all three model architectures correctly classified it as "not a dog." For Book_01.jpg (Object_Name_01.jpg): 
VGG: Misclassified it as "face powder." 
AlexNet: Misclassified it as "face powder." 
ResNet: Misclassified it as "plane, carpenter's plane, woodworking plane."


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The VGG model is the best architecture for classifying the uploaded images. 
It correctly classified the dog breeds and identified all dogs and non-dogs with 100% accuracy, maintaining the same level of performance as AlexNet and ResNet. 
Additionally, VGG is often favored for its high accuracy in breed classification across larger datasets, which aligns with its performance in this smaller dataset.
